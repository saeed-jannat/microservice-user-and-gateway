# user-service-and-gateway
This repository contains a microservices-based project designed to demonstrate modern backend architecture. The project consists of two main components:

1. **User Service**: This service is responsible for handling user-related operations, including authentication, registration,claims,organization,zone,role, and profile management. It ensures secure user data handling and provides endpoints for CRUD operations on user profiles.

2. **API Gateway**: Built using **Ocelot**, this component acts as a single entry point for all incoming requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices, handles load balancing, and provides a unified interface for clients. Ocelot's flexibility and configuration-driven approach make it an excellent choice for managing API routing in a microservices environment.

The project is built using **.NET** for the backend services, ensuring high performance and scalability. It leverages **Docker** for containerization, making it easy to deploy and manage the services in different environments. For data storage, the project uses **SQL Server** to ensure reliable and efficient data management.

Key features of this project include:
- **Microservices Architecture**: The project is divided into independent services, making it modular and easy to maintain.
- **Ocelot API Gateway**: Centralized request routing and load balancing for improved performance and scalability.
- **Containerization**: Docker support allows for seamless deployment and scaling across different environments.
- **Secure Authentication**: The User Service implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, the project can handle increasing loads by scaling individual services.

This project is ideal for developers looking to learn about microservices architecture, API Gateway implementation with Ocelot, and modern backend development practices. It can also serve as a starting point for building scalable and maintainable backend systems.

Technologies used:
- **.NET** for backend development.
- **Ocelot** for API Gateway functionality.
- **Docker** for containerization.
- **SQL Server** for data storage.
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project provides a practical example of how to design, build, and deploy microservices using modern tools and best practices. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your own projects!


The only thing you should do is create tables with the same structure, set up a secret or volume for the private key, and read it from there.
